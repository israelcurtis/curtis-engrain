A simple plugin to demonstrate my skills as your next Senior Backend Developer!

== Description ==

This plugin demonstrates the functionality specified in the Engrain Back-end Developer Assessment exercise. It creates a custom post type `unit`, a settings page for importing data, and a shortcode for rendering the results.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `curtis-engrain.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the Curtis Engrain settings page to begin the API import

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I embed a listing of all the units on my page? =

After you have successfully imported unit records from the API, you can insert the shortcode `[list-units]` on any page or post, and a two-column listing of all the units and their metadata will appear, grouped by Area.
